## Overview
![Cloud-Based Healthcare Management System](Scetch.jpg)
The Cloud-Based Healthcare Management System (CBHMS), developed by Team Dream at the American University of Sharjah, College of Engineering, Computer Science and Engineering Department, is a comprehensive solution designed to streamline healthcare data management. This system centralizes various patient-related data and medical resources, integrating seamlessly with existing Hospital Information Systems (HIS).

### 1.1 Software Context
CBHMS evolves beyond traditional healthcare systems by offering a centralized approach to managing detailed patient demographics, medical histories, and diagnostic images. Through its well-crafted APIs, CBHMS integrates with a range of diagnostic tools and offers a real-time notification system.

### 1.2 Terminology & Definitions
- **CBHMS**: Cloud-Based Healthcare Management System.
- **Patient**: Individuals receiving medical care.
- **Doctor**: Medical professionals using the system.
- **Administrator**: Individuals overseeing CBHMS functionalities.

## System Architecture
### 2.1 Node Architecture
CBHMS features a robust architecture comprising Client Nodes, Diagnostic Tool Nodes, Server Node, and Database Node.

### 2.2 Component Architecture
The system is divided into various components for modularity and scalability:
- **User Interface (UI)**
- **User Authentication & Authorization Component (UAAC)**
- **Patient Records Management Component (PRMC)**
- **Medical Resource Management Component (MRMC)**
- **Analytics & Reporting Component (ARC)**

### 2.3 Data Architecture
CBHMS employs a detailed data structure for Users, Patients, Hospitals, and Doctors, ensuring efficient and secure data management.

## Conclusions & Future Extensions
CBHMS is designed to be scalable, secure, and user-friendly, addressing the needs of patients, healthcare providers, and administrators. Future enhancements could include AI-driven diagnostics, telemedicine, and more integrated patient engagement tools.
